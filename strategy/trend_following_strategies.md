## Overview

Trend following is about patience, discipline, and staying committed to the strategy even during periods of choppy or sideways markets. It's not about predicting the future; it's about riding the waves that already exist

These strategies aim to capture extended moves in financial markets by riding existing trends. Here's what you need to know

1. **Description:**
   - Trend following seeks to profit from sustained price movements (either upward or downward) over the long term.
   - Traders focus on capturing most of these significant moves, not necessarily predicting exact tops or bottoms.
   - Zero forecasting is involved; trend followers react to price action.
2. **Approach:**
   - Identify trends using technical analysis tools (e.g., moving averages, trendlines).
   - Enter trades in the direction of the trend (buy in uptrends, sell in downtrends).
   - Diversify across different asset classes to avoid large drawdowns.
   - Rely on systematic rules rather than discretionary decisions.
   - Adapt to changing market conditions.
3. **Key Points:**
   - **Momentum:** Trend following relies on momentum the persistence of price movements.
   - **Risk Management:** Crucial to limit losses during adverse market conditions.
   - **Diversification:** Spread risk across various assets.
   - **Systematic Rules:** Follow predefined entry and exit criteria.
   - **No Forecasting:** Trend followers don't predict; they react.
4. **Turning Points:**
   - Trend followers seek inflection points where trends change direction.
   - They don't catch every turning point but aim for the majority.
5. **Directional Bias:**
   - Follow the prevailing trend (upward or downward).
   - No contrarian approach trend followers don't bet against the trend.
6. **Exit Strategy:**
   - Use trailing stops or technical indicators to exit when the trend weakens.
   - Avoid holding losing positions too long.
7. **Example:**
   - Imagine a stock that has been consistently rising. A trend follower buys it and holds until signs of reversal appear.
8. **Win/Loss Rate:**
   - Trend following systems often have a lower win rate (not all trades are winners).
   - The focus is on capturing big wins during strong trends.
9. **Volatility Catalysts:**
   - News releases, earnings announcements, or sudden market events can trigger trend movements.
   - High volatility often accompanies trend changes.
10. **Confirmation:**
    - Confirm trend signals with additional technical analysis (e.g., breakout confirmation).
    - Avoid false signals.
11. **Risk Management:**
    - Essential to prevent large drawdowns.
    - Set stop-loss orders to limit losses.

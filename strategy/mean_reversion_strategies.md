## Overview

Mean reversion suggests that prices and returns tend to revert back to their long-term average over time. Traders use this concept to identify potential reversals in price trends.

Mean reversion strategies require adaptability what works in one market condition may not work in another. Successful traders combine mean reversion with other strategies to create a well-rounded approach.

1. **Description:**
   - Mean reversion trading aims to profit from the idea that after extreme price moves (either upward or downward), asset prices tend to revert back to their average levels.
   - This strategy capitalizes on the oscillatory nature of markets, where deviations from the mean eventually correct themselves.
2. **Approach:**
   - Identify potential turning points in asset prices where they have deviated significantly from their historical average.
   - Enter trades anticipating a move back toward the mean.
   - Use statistical tools (such as moving averages, Bollinger Bands, or standard deviation measurements) to gauge deviation from the mean.
3. **Key Points:**
   - **Equilibrium State:** Mean reversion assumes that prices fluctuate around a true average, implying a state of equilibrium.
   - **Normalization:** Traders expect prices to normalize after extreme deviations.
   - **Market Conditions:** Mean reversion works best in well-established markets with reliable historical data.
4. **Turning Points:**
   - Mean reversion traders seek inflection points where trends change direction.
   - These turning points indicate potential opportunities for reversion to the mean.
5. **Momentum:**
   - Unlike momentum strategies, mean reversion traders don't rely on momentum. Instead, they bet against extreme price moves.
6. **Directional Bias:**
   - Mean reversion doesn't follow a directional bias (up or down). It's about capturing deviations, regardless of the prevailing trend.
7. **Exit Strategy:**
   - Set exit points based on the expected return to the mean.
   - Use stop-loss orders to limit losses if the reversion doesn't occur.
8. **Example:**
   - Imagine a stock that has experienced a sharp decline (oversold condition). A mean reversion trader might buy it, expecting it to bounce back toward its historical average.
9. **Win/Loss Rate:**
   - Mean reversion strategies often have a higher win rate (more winning trades) but smaller individual gains.
   - The focus is on consistent, smaller profits.
10. **Volatility Catalysts:**
    - Mean reversion can be triggered by sudden changes in market sentiment, news releases, or shifts in investor behavior.
    - High volatility often accompanies extreme deviations.
11. **Confirmation:**
    - Confirm deviations using technical indicators or statistical measurements.
    - Avoid false signals by waiting for confirmation.
12. **Risk Management:**
    - Crucial to prevent large drawdowns.
    - Set stop-loss orders and manage position sizes carefully.
